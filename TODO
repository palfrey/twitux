* To-do

- Polish existing features, before adding more!
- Fix send messages dialog.  It's incredibly hacky right now.
- After initial timeline retrieval, only retrieve tweets since last retrieval,
  and append those to the gtk_list_store
- Memory profiling of Twitux, it's leaking pretty bad.
- Better icon, would be greatly appreciated.

* My todos:

- Add friends+replies merged timeline (http://code.google.com/p/twitter-api/issues/detail?id=434 would help, but can also be done client-side)
- Add re-tweeting
- Add Facebook support via Open Streams API (http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Using_the_Open_Stream_API)
- Add improved RT support (see https://twitterapi.pbworks.com/Twitter-REST-API-Method:-statuses-home_timeline)
