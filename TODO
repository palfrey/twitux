* To-do

- Polish existing features, before adding more!
- Fix send messages dialog.  It's incredibly hacky right now.
- After initial timeline retrieval, only retrieve tweets since last retrieval,
  and append those to the gtk_list_store
- Memory profiling of Twitux, it's leaking pretty bad.
- Better icon, would be greatly appreciated.
