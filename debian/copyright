    Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at

    successors. Dedicator intends this dedication to be an overt act
    of relinquishment in perpetuity of all present and future rights
    under copyright law, whether vested or contingent, in the

    includes the relinquishment of all rights to enforce (by lawsuit
    or otherwise) those copyrights in the Work.
